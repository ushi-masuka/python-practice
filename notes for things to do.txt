1.Try same ml algos with same data but different data types like int8,int16,int32 etc. to see 
if the performance changes.

2. implement ml algos from scratch.

3. complete dsa repo

4. finish all python assignments from scratch.

5.get working on jarvis again.

ideas while Lect.3 of stanford andrew ng. ml course.

6. check to see if I can take out the error of each instance from say linear 
regression and fit it to different distributions. (then go for glms- lecture 4)

7.actually play around with all the ml algos to see how much real time they take(on different
sized datasets. record the times.). research of different libraries for the same job and do 
the exeriment myself. also check out ways to do using cloud and parallely.
 including single ste linear regression(normal form)

8. explore cost effective ways to run analysis on textual data without gpts, aiming to get better
and accurate analysis in comparison to say what gpt give. for jarvis.
eg use case 1: running analysis on things talked about to gpt and finding trend/interesting 
facts/unique things from that.
eg use case 2: sentiment analyses on the texts maybe even used in diagnosis
eg use case 3: creating a token light way to share context with other llms. (in form of prompts
 or other)
probably using agentic behvaiour with a strongly trained judge/ml/stat expert master agent
