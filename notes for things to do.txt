1.

2. implement ml algos from scratch.

3. complete dsa repo

4. finish all python assignments from scratch.

5.get working on jarvis again.

ideas while Lect.3 of stanford andrew ng. ml course.

6. check to see if I can take out the error of each instance from say linear 
regression and fit it to different distributions. (then go for glms- lecture 4)

7.actually lay around with all the ml algos to see how much real time they take(on different
sized datasets. record the times.). research of different libraries for the same job and do 
the exeriment myself. also check out ways to do using cloud and parallely.
 including single ste linear regression(normal form)
